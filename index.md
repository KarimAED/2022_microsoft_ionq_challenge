### Introduction

- BlackJack is a game of chance where the player tries to reach a sum of 21 with his card values, without going over
- The player is opposed by a dealer, who plays by the same rules
- Whoever gets closer to 21 wins

But that's gambling, we can't allow that...

- Counting cards makes it a game of skill
- But it's hard and requires thinking

__Introducing: QuHackJack__

### Game Concept

- Use quantum computer to generate all random numbers
- Random numbers correspond to playing cards
- Allow the user to manipulate the quantum circuit before drawing a card, to change their odds
